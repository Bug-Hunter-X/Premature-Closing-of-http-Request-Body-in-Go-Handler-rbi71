# Premature Closing of http.Request.Body in Go Handler

This repository demonstrates a common error in Go web applications: prematurely closing the `http.Request.Body` within a request handler.

**Problem:** Closing the request body too early prevents subsequent middleware or other parts of the application from accessing the request's body contents.

**Solution:** Ensure `r.Body.Close()` is called only when appropriate, usually by the caller responsible for creating or using the request, often after all processing is complete.  If your handler needs to read the body, consider using `ioutil.ReadAll` or a reader which handles the closing automatically.
